          Female physiotherapists play an important role in the medical field.

        <p class="blog-1-text">
          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Suppose you're hospitalized, you'll want to have qualified medical
          professionals around you, but does it matter if your doctor is a
          female or a male? </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> It might. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Both male and female medical representatives have their own
          implications in terms of approach. But female health professionals are
          said to spend more time with patients, provide more patient-centred
          care and care with an empathic focus. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Also, studies show that in physiotherapy both men and women feel more
          comfortable with women assisting and treating them. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> The reason behind it is that female doctor are more likely to adhere
          to clinical guidelines and provide more frequent preventive care than
          their male counterparts.</p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> The physiotherapy profession has always been dominated by females
          historically. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> But over the decades this has slowly changed. Physician gender is
          thought to affect the physician-patient relationship and its outcomes.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> A women-led physiotherapist plays a very important role, especially in
          pregnancy. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Pregnancy is said to be the dreamiest phase in a women's life.
          However, this overwhelming phase involves its own share of tensions
          and stress. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> With multiple complications throughout the body, women can go through
          common problems like lower back pain, the severity of injuries,
          weakness of the pelvic floor muscles and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome to
          name a few. Physiotherapy is proven to offer a symptomatic cure to all
          of them and help pregnant women get relief from the discomfort. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> A woman led-physiotherapy can help in the patient being comfortable to
          share her issues and being understood by the therapist. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Though female health care representatives have advantages that are
          multifold, the female-dominated professions in health care are not as
          powerful as the male-dominated medical profession. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> It is said that physiotherapy developed as a profession for
          middle-class women and that the history of physiotherapy is the
          history of the middle-class female profession. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> However, the gender breakdown of physiotherapy programmes shows a very
          significant change over time. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> 70% female students and 30% male students was the female to male ratio
          of students taking up physiotherapy as a profession in 2009/10. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Fast forward ten years from then, the academic year 2019/20 shows 59%
          female students and 41% male students as the change in the ratio.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Undoubtedly the profession of physiotherapy requires the skill of
          understanding and women are said to have better patient outcomes in
          understanding their patient's needs compared to their male peers.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> We all know some strong women either we have been raised by them,
          married to them, or work with them. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Acknowledging the day to show how much importance women play in our
          life! </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Wishing a Happy International Women's Day today from Oremus & family.
