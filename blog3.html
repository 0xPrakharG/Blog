          Manufacturing Challenges in Electronics Industry Post-pandemic

        <p class="blog-1-text">
          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> The pandemic has had a devastating effect on our world. Since the initial outbreak, the disease has spread to nearly every country on the planet. In the pandemic, the world was in upheaval. The pandemic had been devastating on all of us. These were the most remarkable changes from old times in history. It caused millions of deaths and billions of dollars in damages.</p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> From losing our loved ones to losing our homes, it has been worse than ever in a variety of ways. It has been the worst pandemic in the history of mankind. This virus had hit every region of the world and the world was in turmoil. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> Even when the condition is much better now and the world is moving ahead, the post-pandemic situation is not that good. The pandemic destroyed industries and millions of people are living in conditions of depression and desperation. Every aspect of people’s lives was affected and so does every sector of industry to which the manufacturing industry is no exception. The coronavirus has created a great impact on many aspects of life. The industries of the electronics industry are not an exception.</p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> This pandemic has greatly impacted the industry in general and the manufacturing industries in particular. The industry of electronics has been hit much harder than the other industries. In this pandemic, we have witnessed the manufacturing industry affected the most and the worst. The biggest challenge in this pandemic is the fact that the world is running out of resources and many products cannot be produced in any way. The pandemic had caused havoc across the manufacturing industry and also across the world. It has caused havoc in many of the global supply chains and has led to scarcity. </p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text bold"> The manufacturing businesses in the electronics industry are faced with many challenges and some of them are as follows:-</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>Pandemic has affected the product demand. The electronic industry depends heavily on the demand and due to the reduced demand the companies can’t make the same income and it is a great impact on them.</li>
              <li>The pandemic has affected production. The companies are unable to produce the same output.</li>
              <li>The pandemic caused the industry to suffer from a lack of demand because customers are no longer buying electronic products due to online shopping and social distancing.</li>
              <li>One of the main problems is that the pandemic had forced many manufactures to shut their business down or to reduce the number of employees, which makes it harder to manage the demand and to keep the customers satisfied post-pandemic too.</li>
              <li>The demand for many electronic gadgets has declined as people with average income are still recovering from the pandemic too.</li>
            </ul>
          

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> According to a report; the global electronics industry is expected to post-pandemic rebound at a slower pace than in the pre-pandemic period. The slow recovery will be driven by China and South Korea, which accounted for 47% and 14% of global electronics exports, respectively. Other key recovery boosters are Mexico, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and Singapore.</p>

          <p class="blog-1-inner-text"> The manufacturing business lost revenue because COVID-19 caused a reduction in sales for the products and is continuing in the electronics industry even though the pandemic is passed. The pandemic’s effect on the electronics industry has been felt more severely than most other businesses. There has been a general decline in sales due to a lack of customers purchasing devices. This means that the electronics industry is going to take some time to recover from its recent pandemic-affected crisis.
